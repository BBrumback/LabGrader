These are some simple grading scripts that I have created to help with the repeated commands you need to type when grading. There are two different files. Only the grader works right now the unzipper is still being worked on. 

These will probably only work on UNIX systems and you need to have the unzip program installed. you will also need to change the java commands and remove commands to the apporpate files.

To run these you need to used ./grader.bat and ./unzipper.bat
the grader script only works with one file. The way I used it is download a single file and then run the grader script in the download file.

if you have any questions let me know!
